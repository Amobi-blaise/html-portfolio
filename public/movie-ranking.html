<h1>The Best Movies According To Blaise </h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Forever my girl</h3>
<p>I love this movie so much because it depicts love and everything it stands for. It might be fictional, but it just tells a whole lot about my personality.</p>
<h4>Sylvie's Love</h4>
<p>Again, a romance movie. I just have a thing for romance movies.</p>
<h5>Suits</h5>
<p>I love this series. I just love the war between law firms. I also love to see the fights between lawyers in their quest to outsmart themselves and have leveragfe over themselves to win a case or a settlement or a deposition.</p>
